# Properties-of-MRI-k-space-and-parallel-imaging-
The aim of this repository is to get familiar with the properties of MRI k-space and parallel imaging. The task is to investigate different properties of k-space and their influence on image space by using only parts of k-space.

## Task 1

During MRI data acquisition, the space covered by the phase and frequency encoding data is known as the k-space. The k-space and Image space are related by Fourier Transform.
